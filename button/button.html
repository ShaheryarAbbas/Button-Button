    { posword: "Noble", posdefinition: "Noble has a number of meanings, but I like the one which refers to a person showing high moral principles or good personal qualities. I like to think that our aim as humans should be to strive to be noble." },
    { posword: "Respect", posdefinition: "Respect is the feeling of admiration due to their abilities, achievements, or qualities.

    {storytitle: "All the Difference in The World", longstory: " Every Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home.  There’s a lake located in one corner of the park.  Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her.  This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her.  As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was, in fact, a small trap.  There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap.  She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a sponge brush.  “Hello,” I said.  “I see you here every Sunday morning.  If you don’t mind my nosiness, I’d love to know what you’re doing with these turtles.”  She smiled.  “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied.  “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum, reduces the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim.  It can also corrode and weaken the shell over time.”  “Wow!  That’s really nice of you!” I exclaimed.  She went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.  It’s my own strange way of making a difference.”  “But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked.  “Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied.  I scratched my head.  “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent?  I mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.  And 99% of these turtles don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells.  So, no offense… but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?”  The woman giggled aloud.  She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the world.” The Moral of the Story: Each one of us can change the world. Maybe we can’t change the world right away but a single good deed will resonate with the rest of the world. Make every day count by knowing that you are capable of so much good, you just need to be brave to make the world a better place!"},
    {storytitle: "The Weight of the Glass", longstory: "Once upon a time, a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students.  As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question.  Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?”  Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple of pounds.  She replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter.  It all depends on how long I hold it.  If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light.  If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache a little.  If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor.  In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.”  As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your stresses and worries in life are very much like this glass of water.  Think about them for a while and nothing happens.  Think about them a bit longer and you begin to ache a little.  Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.”  The Moral of the Story: On days when you’re stressed out and feeling overwhelmed, learn to embrace the inevitable and let go. Some things cannot be controlled and no amount of worrying could put all your burdens away. Instead of letting stress get to you, embrace it and conquer it. Let yesterday’s worries inspire you to a productive day."},
    {storytitle: "The Butterfly Effect", longstory: "A man stood on the edge of a cliff, peering down at the raging river below. He was deep in thought, considering his options. He had lost his job, his wife had left him, and he had no money in the bank. He was desperate and hopeless.  Just then, a butterfly landed on his shoulder. The man looked at it and smiled. He had always loved butterflies, with their delicate beauty and intricate patterns. He reached out to touch the butterfly, but it took flight, soaring up into the sky.  The man watched it fly away, wondering where it would go and what it would do. And then, a thought struck him: what if that single butterfly had a profound impact on the world? What if, through its actions and movements, it caused a chain of events that changed the course of history?  The man laughed at the absurdity of his thought. But as he continued to ponder it, he realized that it was possible. Every action, no matter how small, has the potential to set off a chain of events that can change the world.  And so, the man made a decision. He would use his time and energy to do good in the world, to make a difference, no matter how small. He would be like that butterfly, flapping his wings and causing a chain of positive events to unfold.  The man walked away from the cliff, feeling lighter and more hopeful than he had in months. He didn’t know exactly how his actions would change the world, but he was determined to try. And who knows? Maybe one day, he would look back and realize that he was the one who caused a chain of events that led to a better world for all.  The Moral of the Story: Every action, no matter how small, has the potential to change the world. So let's be like the butterfly and make a positive impact every day!"},
    {storytitle: "The Power of Words", longstory: "A man once walked into a bar and ordered a drink. As he waited for his drink, he overheard two men in the corner of the bar arguing. One man was yelling and using all sorts of foul language. The other man remained calm and spoke softly. The first man got angrier and angrier as the second man remained calm and collected. The man who had ordered the drink was so struck by the contrast between the two men that he decided to approach them. He asked the man who was yelling why he was so upset and angry. The man explained that he was having trouble with his business and that everything was going wrong. The man who ordered the drink then asked the second man what he thought about the situation. The second man replied, “I believe that words are powerful and I choose to use them wisely. When I speak, I want my words to be filled with positivity and hope, not anger and negativity.” The man who ordered the drink was so inspired by the second man’s response that he decided to change the way he spoke. From that day forward, he made a conscious effort to only use positive, uplifting words. And you know what? It worked! His life changed for the better and he found success in all areas of his life. The moral of the story is that the words we choose to use have the power to shape our lives and the lives of those around us. So choose your words wisely."},
    {storytitle: "Shark Bait", longstory: "During a research experiment, a marine biologist placed a shark into a large holding tank and then released several small bait fish into the tank.  As you would expect, the shark quickly swam around the tank, attacked, and ate the smaller fish.  The marine biologist then inserted a strong piece of clear fiberglass into the tank, creating two separate partitions. She then put the shark on one side of the fiberglass and a new set of bait fish on the other.  Again, the shark quickly attacked.  This time, however, the shark slammed into the fiberglass divider and bounced off.  Undeterred, the shark kept repeating this behavior every few minutes to no avail.  Meanwhile, the baitfish swam around unharmed in the second partition.  Eventually, about an hour into the experiment, the shark gave up.  This experiment was repeated several dozen times over the next few weeks.  Each time, the shark got less aggressive and made fewer attempts to attack the baitfish, until eventually, the shark got tired of hitting the fiberglass divider and simply stopped attacking altogether.  The marine biologist then removed the fiberglass divider, but the shark did not attack.  The shark was trained to believe a barrier existed between it and the baitfish, so the bait fish swam wherever they wished, free from harm.  The Moral of the Story:  Most people tend to give up after facing a series of setbacks and failures. But do not let these setbacks keep you from trying again. Think of each setback as an opportunity to learn. Do not let the barriers that you set for yourself in your mind keep you from achieving your goals. Remember, nothing is impossible if you set your mind to it."},
    {storytitle: "Scent of Love", longstory: "Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived a young man named Jake. He was an artist by heart, and had a keen sense of smell. He would often spend his time at the mall, wandering around and taking in the different scents that surrounded him. He had a particular love for a perfume that he had come across in a high-end department store, the aroma of which was like nothing he had ever smelled before. It was intoxicating, and he couldn't get enough of it. However, there was one problem - the perfume was incredibly expensive. Jake knew that he could never afford to buy it for himself, so he would often sneak into the store and put it on when he had the chance.  One day, while Jake was at the mall, he met a beautiful girl named Isabella. She was rich, elegant, and had a great sense of style. Jake was immediately smitten and couldn't help but stare at her as they passed by each other. Little did he know that Isabella was also a fan of the same perfume that he loved.  They both continued to frequent the mall, and their paths would often cross. They would always smile and wave at each other, but they never had the chance to talk. Jake was too shy to approach her, and Isabella was always busy with her shopping.  As their relationship blossomed, Jake and Isabella would often go on adventures together, exploring the city and trying out new places. They were both from completely different worlds, Jake was an artist and Isabella was from a very wealthy family, but they found that they had so much in common. They both loved to travel and try new things and they were both very adventurous.  One day, while they were out exploring the city, they stumbled upon an old, run-down perfume factory. Intrigued, they decided to go inside and take a look around. Inside, they found that the factory was still in operation, and they were welcomed by the owner who was an old perfumer. He was delighted to see that they were interested in his perfumes and gave them a tour of the factory. Jake and Isabella were fascinated by the process of making perfumes and the old perfumer showed them how to make their own unique scent.  As they were leaving the factory, Jake and Isabella decided to give their new perfume a try. They both put it on, and as soon as they did, they felt a spark. The perfume had become a symbol of their love, and from that day on, they would always wear it together.  With time, their families got to know each other, and they all became close. Jake's family was overjoyed to see him so happy, and Isabella's family was impressed with Jake's artistic talent. They both had different backgrounds and cultures, but they all found that they had a lot in common and they all got along very well.  As their relationship continued to grow, Jake and Isabella knew that they were meant to be together. They had overcome all of the obstacles and differences that they had faced and they had found true love. They knew that they would always be there for each other, no matter what.  In the end, Jake and Isabella lived happily ever after, and their families were forever united. They would often look back on the day they met at the mall and the love that had blossomed from it. They knew that it was fate that brought them together, and they were grateful for every moment they shared. And the perfume that they had made together, would always remind them of the love they shared and the adventures they went on together."},
